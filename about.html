              <p>What started as a COVID-19 pandemic hobby, has slowly became a mild obsession which became incrementally better that the last loaf we baked. It's now been two years and we've gone from a home bakery, to a commercial food space, to now a full blown kitchen space with employees. What transpired after day 1 has completely gone beyond my expectations, and I am immensely proud of the result.</p>

              <p>Since then we've served tens of thousands of you. We've had electrical failures, floods, 1st degree burns. We've served locals, expats, tourists, performers, and to date zero F1 drivers. Authentic moments of rioutous laughter have occurred within our packed 4 walls. Delicate moments between friends and strangers happen nearly every day - and we witness all of them.</p>

              <p>It's very easy to mistake the growing success of this biz on one person, or a small number of people - Breadwinner is successful because friends and early followers made it successful. This business is a collective effort, a collective success, a collective triumph, and everybody who has supported this journey should be super heckin' proud of themselves.</p>
